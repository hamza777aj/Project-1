            <h2>Resume</h2>
            <p>Hi, I graduated West-Mec Aviation Maintenance Technology in July 2020. I gained hands-on experience performing maintenance, preventative maintenance, and inspections. I gained my certificate of completion after two intensive years. During my years at West-Mec, I worked on the weekends at McDonalds as well as attend high school. My first job was a paid internship for the Economic Development Department for the City of Surprise. I would be a part of projects, meetings, and much more. While my time there, I also suggested to build a website, and I built it in two weeks from scratch. The period of the internship was two months long. I’ve worked at McDonalds for a year and a half as crew and maintenance and I would also unload the truck shipments. I would also stock and organize the restaurant. I have experience in maintaining a restaurant to keep it clean, from cleaning the restrooms to the ceilings, I did it all. I have participated in over 30 hours of helping teachers at school as a teacher’s aid, I have helped the City of Surprise with 15 hours at various events, I have also helped represent West-Mec Aviation at air shows and open houses with over 20 hours. I am currently in the process of becoming a software engineer, I know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
